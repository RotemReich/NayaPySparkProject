# NayaPySparkProject
PySpark project

There are 2 Airflow DAGs:
1. pyspark_project_pipeline - To run the the project's core pipeline
2. pyspark_project_stop_processes - in order to stop the detached processes easily

* The last part of the project (Ex. #7 - AlertCounter) is not part of the pipeline since you need to see it on the console.
